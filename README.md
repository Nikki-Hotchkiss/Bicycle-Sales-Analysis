🚴 Excited to share my first end-to-end data analytics project!

📅 Analyzing bicycle sales data from 2016–2017 using SQL & PowerBI

💡 Goal: Apply skills gained through DataCamp’s SQL and PowerBI courses to deliver insights and drive strategic decision-making.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:

▪️ PowerBI: Visualization & dashboard creation


📈 Skills Applied:

▪️ SQL: Joins, aggregates, filters, window functions

▪️ PowerBI: Data cleaning, editing interactions, DAX formulas

▪️ Business acumen: Insightful summary & recommendations


📊 Key Insights:

▪️ Total bicycles sold increased by 16.1%, with net sales rising by $0.97M (40.7%) YoY

▪️ Trek brand sales nearly doubled to $2.1M, up 87% YoY

▪️ Discounts increased by $110K, yet profit margin remained steady at 90%

▪️ While 671 new customers joined, 612 were lost—only 13 retained
