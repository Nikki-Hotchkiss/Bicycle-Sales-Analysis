# Bicycle-Sales-Analysis

I am excited to share my first end-to-end data analytics project exploring and analyzing bicycle sales data from 2016 through 2017!

Goal: To apply the knowledge obtained through DataCamp’s SQL and PowerBI courses and develop a visualization that highlights actionable insights intended to support strategic decision making.

Tools Utilized: 

=>DataLab – AI-powered data notebook used

=>Microsoft SQL Server/ T-SQL – Relational database management system / querying language used

=>PowerBI – Visualization tool used

Skills Applied:

=>SQL Fundamentals – Applying fundamental SQL techniques including joins, aggregates, filtering, and window functions

=> PowerBI – Applying fundamental PowerBI techniques importing data, cleaning data, filtering data, editing interactions, and using DAX functions

=> Business-sense – Providing summary of key insights and recommendations

Key Insights:

=> Total bicycles sold increased by +16.1% while net sales increased by +$0.97M or +40.7% versus last year.

=> Trek brand net sales increased from +$1.1M to +$2.1M resulting in YoY growth of +$0.99M or 87%.

=> Total discounts increased $110K YoY while profit margin remained unchanged sitting at 90% YoY.

=> Total customers increased by 59 YoY. However, the total number of customers retained was only 13 and lost was 612 customers while gaining 671 new customers.

Recommendations:

=> Trek brand sales have shown strong YoY growth - Consider leveraging promotional campaigns to continue to drive YoY growth.

=> Profit margin remains unchanged YoY - Continue to monitor profit margin and net sales by discount category to ensure any new discount strategies are not dilutive.

=> Significant high number of lost customers YoY - Reach out to customers to collect information on overall experience to gain insights and better understand why they left. After completing information collection analyze the information and develop a strategy to win back lost customers.
