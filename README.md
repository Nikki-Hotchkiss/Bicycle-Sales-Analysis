🚴 Excited to share my first end-to-end data analytics project!

📅 Analyzing bicycle sales data from 2016–2017 using SQL & PowerBI

💡 Goal: Apply skills gained through DataCamp’s SQL and PowerBI courses to deliver insights and drive strategic decision-making.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:

📊 Key Insights:

•	🚲 Total bicycles sold increased by 16.1%, with net sales rising by $0.97M (40.7%) YoY

•	🔥 Trek brand sales nearly doubled to $2.1M, up 87% YoY

•	💸 Discounts increased by $110K, yet profit margin remained steady at 90%
